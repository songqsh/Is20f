Notes

- Eqn (5) of Peter Carr paper, why integral on $$(-\infty, \infty)$$ can be written as double of integral on $$[0, \infty)$$ ?
  - If $f$ is real function, then its Fourier transform has even real part and odd imaginary part.
- find $$\lim_{k\to -\infty} e^{ik+\alpha k}$$? Discuss your answer with the sign of $\alpha$.
