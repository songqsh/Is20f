Notes on Peter Carr paper

- Eqn (5), why integral on $(-\infty, \infty)$ can be written as double of integral on $[0, \infty)$?
  - If $f$ is real function, then its Fourier transform has even real part and odd imaginary part.
- find $$\lim_{k\to -\infty} e^{ik+\alpha k}$$? Discuss your answer with the sign of $\alpha$.
- Prove Eqn (7)?
